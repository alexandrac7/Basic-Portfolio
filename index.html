                <p>I'm a bartender and sommelier at Agustin Kitchen. I have an English degree, so my background is in literature and creative writing, but I'm momentarily disenchanted with fiction. I've been occupying my time with books and documentaries on addiction and true crime (there's some overlap, but not as much as you might think.) I would love to use newfound coding skills to develop wine education tools for restaurant staff.</p>
